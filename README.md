## (DEPRECATED, NOT UPDATED SINCE 2017)

# Tools & Links Database <img src="storage.png" width="24">

I was bored to losing time when I was searching for something in my bookmarks, so I created this. 

> A stack of tutorials, articles, links, plugins, templates bookmarked month after month. It's time to sort them.

- Contributions are more than welcome. Please see [contribution guide](add.md).

## [Search in database](https://stabla.github.io/ToolsLinksList/)

If you're looking for CSS's loader, enter `css loader` in search bar and engine will collect in local database what you want.


# Modification/Improvement
Because internet and related technologies are moving and changing really fast, if you see a dead link, or an outdated technology/plugin/tutorial, let me now ! I care a lot about relevance of the database !

If you have some security tutorials, plugins, scripts, share it ! We need them !
